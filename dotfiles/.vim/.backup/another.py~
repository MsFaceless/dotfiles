                                    There are some personal information fields that you have to fill in if you want Dotxml to
                                    provide you with your chosen product and/or service or on-board you as an employee,
                                    supplier, director or job applicant. This information can be provided in writing,
                                    electronically or telephonically, but it must be accurate and complete. These fields are
                                    indicated by an asterisk (or as otherwise indicated) on the respective forms/websites. If
                                    Dotxml does not receive the necessary personal information, we will not be able to
                                    continue with your application. If you are already a(n)
                                    customer/employee/supplier/director and Dotxml asks you for this information and you
                                    do not provide it, Dotxml will have to suspend the provision of the product and/or services for a period of time,
                                    or as the case may be, even terminate our relationship with you.

                                    In most cases, personal information will be collected directly from you, but there may be
                                    other instances when Dotxml will collect personal information from other sources. These
                                    may include public records, places where you may already have made your personal
                                    information public (for example, on social media), credit bureaus, or individuals/directors
                                    whom you have appointed as your representative, where you are a corporate entity.
                                    Dotxml will only collect your personal information from other sources where we are
                                    legally entitled or obliged to do so, and you are entitled to ask Dotxml which sources
                                    they used to collect your personal information.
                                </li>

                                    For the purposes outlined in paragraph 9 (above), Dotxml will, in most instances, collect
                                    and process your personal information internally. However, there are times when
                                    Dotxml needs to outsource these functions to third parties, either within Dotxml or
                                    external to Dotxml, including parties in other countries. Where your personal information
                                    is shared internally within Dotxml, such sharing will be carried out only for the purposes
                                    outlined in paragraph 9 (above). Dotxml may also need to share your personal
                                    information with external organisations, such as credit bureaus, tax authorities or other
                                    regulatory or industry bodies, so that we can meet our due diligence or regulatory
                                    requirements. We may need to share your personal information with our business
                                    partners or counter-parties, where we are involved in corporate transactions relating to
                                    the sale or transfer of any of our businesses, legal entities or assets. Dotxml will not
                                    share your personal information with third parties who do not need your personal
                                    information, or where Dotxml is not legally permitted to do so. When Dotxml decides to
                                    transfer your personal information to third parties, we will only provide it to organisations
                                    that have the same data privacy policies as Dotxml or those who are subject to laws
                                    relating to the processing of personal information that are similar to those that apply to
                                    Dotxml.

                                    There may be instances where Dotxml will process your personal information through a
                                    secure automated tool, or perform profiling resulting in a decision that may affect you
                                    significantly. If you are unhappy about the outcome of such a decision, please contact:
